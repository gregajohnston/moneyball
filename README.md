# Moneyball

## Introduction

Just like the popular book and movie, Moneyball attempts to determine a statistical way of assigning value to baseball players, not only by performance on the field, but also taking into account the salary of the player. Thus a monetary valuation of the player's contribution can be described and compared to other players. The end result is to find "bargain" players that create more statistical benefits for their team at a minimum of salary.
